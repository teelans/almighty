Certainly! A more sophisticated approach to simulate time series data, preserving properties like drawdowns and autocorrelation, is to utilize a Block Bootstrap technique. Block bootstrapping captures the dependence structure by resampling blocks of data rather than individual observations.

Here's how you can perform Block Bootstrap:

1. **Divide the Time Series into Blocks**: To preserve autocorrelation and local trends (e.g., drawdowns), split the series into overlapping or non-overlapping blocks of data. 
2. **Sample with Replacement**: Resample these blocks and concatenate them to create new time series paths.

The Python code below implements the Block Bootstrap approach:

```python
import numpy as np

def block_bootstrap(original_series, block_size, n_paths=1000, overlapping=True):
    if overlapping:
        # Create overlapping blocks
        blocks = [original_series[i:i+block_size] for i in range(len(original_series) - block_size + 1)]
    else:
        # Create non-overlapping blocks
        n_blocks = len(original_series) // block_size
        blocks = [original_series[i*block_size:(i+1)*block_size] for i in range(n_blocks)]
    
    paths = []
    for _ in range(n_paths):
        # Sample blocks with replacement
        sampled_blocks = [blocks[np.random.randint(0, len(blocks))] for _ in range(len(blocks))]
        
        # Concatenate sampled blocks
        simulated_path = np.concatenate(sampled_blocks)
        
        # Limit the path to the original series length
        paths.append(simulated_path[:len(original_series)])
    
    return paths

# Test with your original_series
original_series = np.random.normal(0, 1, 250).cumsum()  # This is just a dummy time series
paths = block_bootstrap(original_series, block_size=20, n_paths=10, overlapping=True)

# You can then plot or analyze the generated paths.
```

Few things to consider:

- **Block Size**: The choice of block size is crucial. A small block size might not adequately capture the dependence structure, while a very large one might be too rigid. Experiment with various sizes or consider an adaptive method to choose the optimal size based on the properties you wish to preserve.
  
- **Overlapping vs. Non-overlapping**: Overlapping blocks tend to be more flexible and can capture complex structures better, but they also increase the chance of overfitting to the original series. Non-overlapping blocks are simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting but might miss finer structures.

You can further enhance the realism by combining Block Bootstrap with other methods or statistical adjustments, depending on the specific properties of your time series you wish to emphasize.
